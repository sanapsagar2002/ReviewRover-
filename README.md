# Review-Rover

This project builds a simple AI agent that answers questions about a pizza restaurant based on customer reviews.

1.Embeddings are created using mxbai-embed-large with Ollama.

2.Vector search is powered by Chroma to retrieve the most relevant reviews.

3.Responses are generated by Llama 3.2 1B running locally through Ollama.

4.LangChain is used to connect the pieces together smoothly.
